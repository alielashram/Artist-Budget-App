Artist-Budget-App
=================
With this app I hope to help artists, or anyone with an irregular income, budget their lives effectively. Many times artists fit the "starving artist" mold and in such a scenario, budgeting their lives as thoroughly as possible and prioritizing expenses is essential. Artists' budgets are different from the common person's. There are many financial commitments swirling around that are not constant from month to month, so a more personalized budgeting system is needed. Most artists are not very meticulous in their budgeting. So, having an app that helps them keep their finances organized in a central place would be a great help.
The aim is to render these two resources into one convenient app:
